### Much simpler way to write a C script to manage devices using ssh
- Cleaned up safer version of the script is c_sshv2.c
  - use of snprintf() is considered better practice to avoid buffer overruns 
- So I will say this was a hell of a lot easier than using libssh.
- I used **stdlib.h** with **system()** which can call shell commands, and in my case ssh.
- I did install sshpass to call the password in the script so I didn't have to keep entering it while the script was running.
- This script was a good lesson in utilizing tools that are already at our disposal, its just a matter of taking advantage of them.
