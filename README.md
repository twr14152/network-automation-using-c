# Network Scripts written in C to configure and operate network devices
### 08/18/2025
- I asked for feedback on this repo on reddit to see if there might be any interest in the topic of using C for automation. Got some good feedback, and I would say there not much enthusiam for this topic. (Shame... Oh well :)) 
- An individual pointed out that the ssh command itself could basically do what one of my cli ssh scripts could do. He was referring this command 'ssh username@host "cmd1"'. And he was right. I thought for a moment wow a single command can do that? What the hell am I doing..
- Then it occured to me. I wasn't trying to rebuild the linux ssh. I was just trying to use c and a library (libssh) together to learn how to write useful script to manage network devices. Sure it was a long and windy road but this was learning exercise and it worked. So while a little embarrassed that I didnt know the single ssh command could do that much.  I don't regret the effort put in at all. The scripts did work.  
- But it did get me thinking, why not simplify the ssh script to just utilize the existing linux ssh command to run commands on multiple devices. So how can I do that? The answer is using the **stdlib.h** it has a function called **system()**. This function allows you to call linux shell commands. The script is far smaller and way easier to write and modify.
- Upon further investigation the use of system(ssh cmd) is ***NOT recommended*** for anything but simple quick use cases. System() is less equipped to handle errors or responses in a programatic way. Hense why the recommend libssh for building clients.
-  I need to give gentleman who brought this up on reddit his due he was correct in that the linux shell command is very capable. Without investigating it I wouldnt know how capabable.
-  I do need to preface this, I used C because thats what this repo is about, but you can do the same thing with python, bash, Go...etc... I'm guessing it would be even easier, but again thats not what this is about....

  * cisco/example3/c_ssh.c

- Putting http_client_using_files.c to use in a shell script.
- Enable restconf with self signed cert. (Update...While it shows restconf enabled the yang models are not present, restconf data path non-existent.) Possible user error. Code did deploy properly, the feature just is not working.
- The self-signed-cert was manually done per device as it was first time setting it up and it was giving me issues with common name when scripted. I didnt care enough to mess with it further,so i just manually did that part. I hate dealing with certs. I think they are the worst part of networking.
- Finally save configs to memory on each device
  * arista/httpClient/run_http_cmds.sh
  * arista/httpClient/wr_mem.sh
### 07/27/2025
- Added http client that will use a command file to run configuration and verification commands using eAPI
- Also did away with having use the full url to reach the device just need to use the host address or name.
### 07/24/2025
- I added http client code
- Currently its code that runs Cli commands from http using arista eAPI
- I used libcurl library to build it. The documentation was really good with lots examples.
  * https://curl.se/libcurl/
- I added cjson to make the response data easier to read
- At this point thats all of I have
  * arista/httpClient/http_client_run_cmds.c
### 07/14/2025
- I ended up breaking up the config and exec commands functions into seperate scripts
- The logic seemed cleaner as interactive shell seem appropriate for config functions more than exec commands
  * cisco/example2/ssh_conf.c - configuration script
  * cisco/example2/ssh_exec_cmds.c - show commands script
- Next task is to try and come up with a way to configure multiple devices
- So example3 show's how you could deploy and validate changes to your network using this code.
- I didn't write additional c code to perform this I actually used a little bash to act as the orchestrator for this change.
- The README shows the examples and how they were rolled out and validated
  * arista/example3/pre_change_status.sh
  * arista/example3/push_conf_change.sh
  * arista/example3/post_change_status.sh
  * arista/example3/rem_conf_change.sh

### 07/13/2025
- Added option for configure file to the Cisco device we are testing
- ~cisco/example2/ssh_script.c~ 
- The cisco device did not honor end of line ";" that arista ceos did the result was anything beyond the interface description became part of the description.
- I had to use interactive shell to get it to properly take the commands.
- Techinically this the more appropriate way of dealing with multiple nested commands in configuration mode.

### 07/12/2025
- In example2 I added the option to have a seperate file which can hold your device configuration or show commands. Its just a text file. Call it what ever you want. Then call it when your run your script. Its based off of a positional argument. So the name of the file could be anything.
- arista/example2/ssh_script.c
- I've include a readme file in that directory to help explain
- I have not started on the Cisco example2 yet.

### 07/11/2025
- I really enjoy working with C. My background is in networking so why not try and see if I can make some use of it? I know screen scraping is not real sexy in the automation community but like it or not,  it's useful...
- This repository will hold scripts that I write for the purposes of knowledge building, retention, and sharing.
- So far I've created two scripts using libssh library. I pieced them together from the tutorial (https://api.libssh.org/stable/libssh_tutorial.html)
- Not going to lie these first scripts were challenging and took sometime and effort to get working properly. Lots of debugging, especially the arista because of its authentication method.
- These two scripts represent two very different forms of authentication using SSH. The Cisco device was more straight forward. 
   * arista/example1/ssh_cli_script.c - This script that works by using keyboard_interactive authentication
   * cisco/example1/ssh_cli_script.c - This script works by using password authentication
- The test envionments will probably change over time but for now 
   * I will use Containerlab for arista ceos and potentially other devices
   * Devnet sandbox for cisco - This first example used always on nxos.
- Now I understand the the usefulness of using a script in this fashion is more for a lab environment without the need for safeguards. My goal is to create more production ready format for these scripts. But you need to start somewhere. I also hope to grow beyond screen scraping but for now, it is what it is.
- It would seem using the right tool for the right job may not have a place in this repo after all we are using c for network scripting. That said I may include some bash rather using c as an orchestrator to launch multiple instances of a script.
- I will try an improve the scripts as I gain more understanding
- This may not go very far, but wont know your limits until you try.
- Lastly why c? Why not? I like it...
